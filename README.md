# Gnome V.S. Knights Text Based RPG
This is just a mini text based RPG I made, because I just completed my C# beginner course. Better played with the .exe and not in the editor.

# How to use:
Downlod VsCode or Visual Studio. Create a new C# Console App Project. Copy and paste the Program.cs file into your project, and then change the namespace to whatever you want.

# Running:
Press F5 on your keyboard (or run), and then it will run the program. Follow the instructions in the app, and play the game!
